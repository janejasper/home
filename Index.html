In addition to her editorial work, she has years of buying experience, having worked at Ksubi and Belinda before venturing out on her own. She owned and operated cult boutique Land’s End Store for 6 years, representing international top-end brands like Celine, Proenza Schouler and Balmain - many exclusively - making Lands End the destination for fashion-forward luxury. Seeking more flexibility than a demanding retail schedule allowed, and seeing a gap in the market for consumer based personal styling, with her new enterprise Jasper aims to help her clients build smartly chosen wardrobes tailored to their individual style.</span></h2>
